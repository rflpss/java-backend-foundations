# 🔄 Java Repetitive Structures (While Loop)

Implementation of algorithms using the `while` control structure.
Focused on scenarios where the number of iterations is not previously known.
*Based on Dr. Nelio Alves' Java Course.*

## 🧠 Key Concepts
* **While Loop:** executing a block of code as long as a condition remains true.
* **Control Flags:** using specific values (like `0` or `4`) to terminate loops.
* **Data Accumulation:** counting and summing variables inside a loop iteration.
* **Logic flow:** Reading inputs repeatedly until valid data is provided.

## 📋 Exercises Solved

### 1. Access Control System (Password)
A security logic that keeps requesting a password until the correct one (`2002`) is entered.
* **Feature:** validation loop.

### 2. Cartesian Quadrants
Reads coordinates `(X, Y)` indefinitely and determines which quadrant they belong to (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th).
* **Stop condition:** Loop breaks when any coordinate is `0`.

### 3. Gas Station Survey (Data Analysis)
A survey algorithm that reads the type of fuel customers prefer (Alcohol, Gasoline, Diesel) and generates a final report.
* **Logic:** Uses a `while` loop to collect data and prints the statistical summary when the code `4` is entered.
