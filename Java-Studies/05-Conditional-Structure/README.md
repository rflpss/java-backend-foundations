# 🚦 Java Conditional Structures (If-Else)

Practice module focused on Decision Making structures and Business Logic implementation.
*Based on Dr. Nelio Alves' Java Course.*

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
* **Control Flow:** `if`, `else if`, `else`.
* **Logical Operators:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
* **Mathematical Logic:** Modulo operator (`%`) for even/odd checks.
* **Complex Business Rules:** Implementing tax brackets and coordinate systems.

## 📋 Exercises List

### 1. Basic Checks
* **Negative/Non-Negative:** Simple boolean check.
* **Even or Odd:** Using the modulus operator (`% 2`).
* **Multiples:** Checking if two numbers are multiples of each other.

### 2. Time & Geometry
* **Game Duration:** Logic to calculate hours considering day changes (24h format).
* **Quadrant Coordinates:** Nested conditions to locate points on a Cartesian plane (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Axis, Origin).
* **Intervals:** Categorizing numbers into specific ranges `[0,25]`, `[25,50]`, etc.

### 3. Business Logic (Mini-Systems)
* **Snack Bar POS:** A menu system that calculates the bill based on product code and quantity.
* **Income Tax Calculator (Lisarb):** A complex financial algorithm that calculates tax based on variable salary brackets using cumulative rates (0%, 8%, 18%, 28%).
