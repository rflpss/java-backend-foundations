# Java Algorithms, Logic & Web Foundations

## 📖 About this Project
This repository documents my journey mastering Computer Science fundamentals and Web Development. It serves as a practical portfolio of **Algorithmic Logic**, **Problem Solving**, and **Frontend Basics**.

## 🛠 Concepts & Tech Stack

* **Java 21:** Strongly typed logic, Control Flow (Sequential, Conditional, Loops), Data Types, and Input/Output handling.
* **Problem Solving:** Efficient solutions for mathematical and logical challenges (based on URI/Beecrowd problems).
* **Clean Code:** Focus on readability, proper indentation, and naming conventions (camelCase).
* **Frontend:** HTML5 & CSS3 (Responsive Layouts & Box Model).

## 🚀 Featured Implementations

### Logic & Algorithms
* **Tax Calculator (Lisarb):** Complex logic implementation using cumulative marginal tax rates and chained conditional structures (`if/else if`).
* **Interval Checker:** Mathematical interval validation using logical operators and defensive programming.
* **Game Duration Logic:** Algorithm to calculate time duration spanning across different days (24h logic).

### Web Development
* **Coffee Shop Landing Page:** A responsive web page using semantic HTML and CSS styling (Box Model, Flexbox concepts).
